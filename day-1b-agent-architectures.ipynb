Imagine a software architecture where independent, intelligent \"agents\" collaborate to solve problems, adapt to change, and optimize performance. This isn't science fiction; it's the power of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and they're poised to revolutionize how we build software.\n\n---\n\n**Section 1: The Power of Decomposition - Breaking Down Complexity**\n\n*   **Modular and Independent Units:** MAS breaks down large, intricate problems into smaller, manageable tasks handled by individual agents. This makes code easier to understand, develop, and debug.\n*   **Specialized Expertise:** Each agent can be designed with specific skills and knowledge, leading to more efficient and optimized solutions for particular sub-problems. Think of them as tiny, expert teams working under one roof.\n*   **Enhanced Maintainability:** When you need to update or fix a specific functionality, you only need to focus on the relevant agent, minimizing the risk of introducing unintended side effects elsewhere in the system.\n\n**Section 2: Adaptability and Resilience - Building Software That Thrives**\n\n*   **Dynamic Problem Solving:** Agents can communicate, negotiate, and coordinate their actions to respond to changing environments or unexpected situations in real-time. This makes your software more robust and less prone to failure.\n*   **Fault Tolerance:** If one agent fails, the system can often continue operating by reallocating tasks or using alternative agents, creating a more resilient architecture.\n*   **Scalability on Demand:** MAS naturally lends itself to scaling. You can easily add more agents to handle increased load or introduce new functionalities without a complete system overhaul.\n\n**Section 3: Intelligence and Optimization - Driving Smarter Software**\n\n*   **Distributed Decision-Making:** Agents can make localized decisions based on their own perceptions and goals, leading to more efficient and responsive systems.\n*   **Emergent Behavior:** Complex and intelligent behavior can emerge from the interactions of simple agents, often leading to solutions that a single monolithic program might not achieve.\n*   **Continuous Learning and Improvement:** Agents can be designed to learn from their experiences and adapt their strategies over time, leading to continuously improving performance and effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n**Concluding Thought:**\n\nFor software developers, embracing Multi-Agent Systems isn't just about adopting a new paradigm; it's about unlocking a more agile, intelligent, and robust future for your applications. By leveraging the collective power of independent agents, you can build software that is not only easier to manage but also more capable of tackling the complex challenges of tomorrow.

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: 'One-Shot' Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-11T01:16:25.754252Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-11T01:16:25.757412Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T01:16:25.771283Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-11T01:16:25.757349Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T01:16:25.770094Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

Is he lonely, bored, yearning for adventure, or content with his solitary life? A brief hint at his baseline emotional state would make the impact of the map's discovery more profound. For example, you could add a sentence early on like, \"Years of solitude had carved deep lines into his face, but also a quiet contentment,\" before introducing the anomaly.\n\n2.  **Enhance the sensory details of the map.** You've done a great job with \"woven moonlight\" and \"pulsed like tiny stars.\" Consider adding another sense, perhaps touch or even sound. Does the map feel cool or warm to the touch? Does it emit a faint hum or whisper? This could add another layer of intrigue and make the map feel even more otherworldly.\n\n3.  **Create more immediate tension or a hint of what's to come.** The discovery is exciting, but what are the immediate implications? Is there a sense of urgency about the map? Does Elias feel drawn to it in a way that overrides his usual caution? Consider adding a subtle hint about the potential danger or the immense power of what he's found. For example, the symbols could momentarily flicker, or Elias might feel a strange pull towards a specific direction on the map.\nRefinerAgent > Elias polished the lantern glass, its familiar scent of oil and brine a comfort in the vast, lonely dark.
